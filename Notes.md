# Macro Creator

## UI Design
There's a couple main features
1. Scratch like block programming for the macros
2. Top toolbar for basic features (save, load, etc.)
3. Preview on the right side for some features such as image previews

I'm thinking the best UI framework to use would be Azul, it's Electron but Firefox instead of Chrome.
I mean, it's certainly not the best ever, but it would undeniably work quite well for my plans.
If I'm going to copy Scratch, might as well take a couple notes out of that book and make it web based as well.

The UI is simply the front end, not entirely sure what the correct way
about doing this is though.

Do I make the front end and back end separate exes or just separate 
parts of the same program?
